        <h1> PIZZA</h1>
        <p>Pizza is an Italian, specifically Neapolitan, dish typically consisting of a flat base of leavened wheat-based
        dough topped with tomato, cheese, and other ingredients, baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired
        oven.</p>
        <p>The term pizza was first recorded in 997 AD, in a Latin manuscript from the southern Italian town of Gaeta, in Lazio, on
        the border with Campania.[2] Raffaele Esposito is often credited for creating the modern pizza in Naples.[3][4][5][6] In
        2009, Neapolitan pizza[7] was registered with the European Union as a traditional speciality guaranteed (TSG) dish. In
        2017, the art of making Neapolitan pizza was included on UNESCO's list of intangible cultural heritage.[8]
        
        Pizza and its variants are among the most popular foods in the world. Pizza is sold at a variety of restaurants,
        including pizzerias (pizza specialty restaurants), Mediterranean restaurants, via delivery, and as street food.[9] In
        Italy, pizza served in a restaurant is presented unsliced, and is eaten with the use of a knife and fork.[10][11] In
        casual settings, however, it is typically cut into slices to be eaten while held in the hand. Pizza is also sold in
        grocery stores in a variety of forms, including frozen or as kits for self-assembly. Store-bought pizzas are then cooked
        usinga home oven. </p>
